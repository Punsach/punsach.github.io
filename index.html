<h2>Hi, I'm Puneet 👋</h2>

<h3>What I Do</h3>
<p>
  I’m a backend and distributed systems engineer who spends most of my time building 
  high-throughput infrastructure and large-scale notification systems at LinkedIn. 
  I love working on the pieces of the stack that keep things fast, reliable, and ready to scale.
</p>

<p>Some of the big things I’ve worked on include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scaling our notification pipelines</strong> so they can handle tens of billions of events a day without slowing down.</li>
  <li><strong>Reworking our storage architecture</strong> (including an unseen/seen dual-database split) to boost throughput and give our systems real-time access to a member's notification state.</li>
  <li><strong>Powering AI-driven improvements</strong> like smarter ranking, reordering, and relevance scores by giving ML models the context they need at decision time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In short: I like building systems that make huge amounts of data feel easy to work with and open the door for better, more personalized user experiences.
</p>

<h3>When I'm Not Working</h3>
<p>
  When I’m not deep in systems, you’ll usually find me doing one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>🥾 Getting outside for a hike (local trails, longer trips, pretty much anything scenic).</li>
  <li>📚 Reading fantasy or sci-fi. A few favorites: N.K. Jemisin, Joe Abercrombie, and Will Wight.</li>
  <li>🍜 Hunting down fun pop-ups and new food spots around San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
